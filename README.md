A comprehensive collection of expertly crafted meta tags to optimize web page performance, enhance search engine visibility, and improve social media sharing capabilities.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Description of my web page" />
```

This code is a meta tag that provides a description of a web page to search engines and other web crawlers. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "description". The "content" attribute provides a brief summary of the page's content, which is typically displayed below the page title in search engine results. This tag can help improve the visibility and ranking of a web page in search results by providing a clear and concise summary of its content.

---

```html
<meta name="keywords" content="keywords, that, describe, my, web, page" />
```

This code is meta tag that provides a list of keywords that describe the content of a web page. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "keywords". The "content" attribute provides a comma-separated list of relevant keywords that are associated with the page's content. This tag used to be a more significant factor in search engine optimization (SEO) in the past, but now search engines rely more on the actual content of the page rather than just the keywords. However, including relevant keywords can still be helpful in improving the visibility and relevance of a web page in search results.

```html
<meta name="author" content="My Name" />
```

This code is a meta tag that identifies the author of a web page. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "author". The "content" attribute provides the name of the person who created the web page. This tag can be useful for giving credit to the author of a page and can help readers identify who to contact if they have any questions or comments about the content. Additionally, it can help search engines verify the legitimacy of a web page and improve its ranking.

---

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

This code is a meta tag that sets the viewport of a web page for optimal viewing on various devices. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "viewport". The "content" attribute provides instructions on how to display the web page's content on different devices.

The content value "width=device-width" sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device. This means that the page will adjust its layout and size according to the user's device, whether it's a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer.

The "initial-scale=1.0" attribute sets the initial zoom level of the page to 100%. This ensures that the page's content appears appropriately on the user's device, without any need for the user to manually zoom in or out.

In summary, this tag ensures that the web page is displayed in an optimized manner for various screen sizes, making it more user-friendly and accessible on different devices.

```html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
```

This code is a meta tag that enables a web application to be launched in full-screen mode on an iOS device when added to the home screen. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable". The "content" attribute provides a value of "yes" to enable the full-screen mode feature.

When a user saves a web application to their home screen on an iOS device, the application will typically launch in a browser window with browser navigation elements (such as the address bar and browser tabs) still visible. However, when this meta tag is used, the web application will launch in full-screen mode, without any browser navigation elements, making it look and feel more like a native app.

Note that this meta tag only affects the behavior of a web application when added to the home screen on iOS devices, and has no effect on other devices or platforms.

```html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black" />
```

This code is a meta tag that defines the style of the status bar on an iOS device when a web application is launched from the home screen. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style". The "content" attribute provides a value of "black" to set the style of the status bar.

The status bar is the area at the top of the screen on an iOS device that displays information such as the time, battery level, and cellular signal strength. When a web application is launched from the home screen, the status bar can be styled to match the design of the application.

The "black" value sets the background color of the status bar to black, which is useful for applications with a dark color scheme. Other possible values for this attribute include "default", "black-translucent", and "white".

Note that this meta tag only affects the behavior of a web application when added to the home screen on iOS devices, and has no effect on other devices or platforms.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />
```

This code is a meta tag that provides instructions to search engine robots on how to index and follow links on a web page. The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being defined, in this case, "robots". The "content" attribute provides a list of instructions for search engine robots to follow.

The "index" value indicates that the search engine should include this web page in its search results. The "follow" value indicates that the search engine should follow any links on the page to other pages.

Other possible values for the "content" attribute include "noindex" (which tells the search engine not to index the page) and "nofollow" (which tells the search engine not to follow links on the page).

It's important to note that this meta tag is a directive, and not a guarantee that search engines will behave according to the specified instructions. While most search engines follow these instructions, some may not. Additionally, this meta tag only applies to search engine robots and has no effect on human visitors to the web page.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/my-page" />
```

This code is a link tag that defines the canonical URL for a web page. The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current page and the linked page, in this case, "canonical". The "href" attribute provides the canonical URL for the web page.

The canonical URL is the preferred version of a web page that search engines should use when indexing and ranking the page. This is useful in situations where a web page has multiple URLs (such as through URL parameters or multiple domains), but the content on each URL is largely similar. By specifying the canonical URL, website owners can avoid duplicate content issues and help search engines understand which version of the page to prioritize in search results.

For example, if a website has a page with multiple URLs such as "https://www.example.com/my-page", "https://example.com/my-page", and "https://www.example.com/my-page?utm_source=google", the website owner can specify the canonical URL as "https://www.example.com/my-page" using this meta tag. This tells search engines to index and rank the content on this URL, and to ignore the other variations of the URL.

```html
<meta name="googlebot" content="index,follow" />
```

This code is a meta tag that provides instructions specifically to Google's search engine crawler (Googlebot) on how to index and follow links on a web page.

The "index" value indicates that Google should include this web page in its search results. The "follow" value indicates that Googlebot should follow any links on the page to other pages.

Other possible values for the "content" attribute include "noindex" (which tells Google not to index the page) and "nofollow" (which tells Google not to follow links on the page).

It's important to note that this meta tag is a directive, and not a guarantee that Googlebot will behave according to the specified instructions. While Google generally follows these instructions, there are cases where Googlebot may not follow them, such as when the instructions conflict with Google's guidelines. Additionally, this meta tag only applies to Google's search engine crawler and has no effect on other search engines or human visitors to the web page.

The "content" attribute provides the value of the metadata, which is the unique identifier of the iPhone app that should be used to open the content.

In the example you provided, the "twitter:app:id:iphone" property specifies the ID of the app as "App ID". This meta tag is used in conjunction with the "twitter:app:name:iphone" meta tag to provide additional information about the content being shared on Twitter and the corresponding mobile app that can be used to view the content. This meta tag is optional and is not required for Twitter cards to work properly, but it can be useful in certain cases where it's important to provide additional information about the app being used to view the content.

The no-referrer-when-downgrade value specifies that the Referer header should not be sent when navigating from an HTTPS page to an HTTP page, but should be sent for all other navigations. This helps protect the privacy and security of users by limiting the amount of information that is passed between websites.
